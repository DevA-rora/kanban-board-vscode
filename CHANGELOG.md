## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-11

First stable release. Published on the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DevArora.bento) and [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/DevArora/bento).

### Added

- Title-bar toggle between kanban and markdown on `todo.md`.
- Dynamic toolbar visibility via `setContext` so the toggle works on dotted filenames.
- Extension icon (128×128) for the Marketplace listing.
- Empty-state UI when `todo.md` has no columns.
- Theme-aware styling via VS Code CSS variables for light, dark, and high-contrast themes.
- Keyboard shortcut **n** to add a new card in the focused column.
- Open VSX listing for Cursor, VSCodium, and other VS Code forks.
- Open VSX verified publisher namespace for `DevArora`.

### Changed

- Optimistic board sync so edits no longer snap back before save.

### Fixed

- Focus ring visibility on the keyboard-focused card.
- Long description text wrapping on cards.
- Instant delete sync without waiting for manual save.

## [0.0.2] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- Keyboard shortcuts in the kanban webview: arrow navigation, Space to complete, Enter to edit, Tab between fields, Escape to stop editing, V + arrow to move cards, Delete/Backspace to remove a card.
- README keyboard shortcuts table, demo GIF, and static screenshots.
- README requirements section, commands table, and changelog link.

### Changed

- Marketplace listing assets aligned with the GitHub README.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-06-18

First public release on the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DevArora.bento).

### Added

- Custom kanban editor for any `todo.md` file in the workspace.
- Drag-and-drop cards between columns and reorder cards within a column.
- Drag columns to reorder the board.
- Double-click to edit card titles and descriptions in place.
- Completion toggle on each card (dim + strikethrough).
- Right-click context menu to delete cards.
- One-click add for new cards (per column) and new columns (end of board).

- **Open Bento Board** command to create or open a starter `todo.md`.

### Fixed

- Duplication when dragging a card into an empty column.
